The objective was to make a visualization that demonstrates the relationship between tweet length, number of hashtags, and audience engagement. The data was obtained from https://github.com/Remesh/tweet-data.

There are several ways to run this code and get visualizations depending upon the technology available.   

Audience engagement for a tweet was defined to be the sum of its likes and retweets. These are all the ways other users can directly interact with a tweet.
